## Go pub quiz – Tom Payne

So you think you know Go? Combine your knowledge of Go project trivia and weird language corner-cases with your teammates to find out which team knows Go the best. There aren't any prizes, the scores don't matter, and I'm sure that everybody (including me) will learn something from the talk.

## TinyGo & Micro:bit – Lucas Bremgartner

We explore the capabilities and differences between regular Go and TinyGo while looking at some real code executed on the Micro:bit.
TinyGo is a new compiler for the Go programming language that focuses on compiling code written in Go, but for smaller kinds of systems like for example BBC Micro:bit, a 16MHz CPU with 16 kB of RAM.
