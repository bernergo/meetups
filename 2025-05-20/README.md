## Topic 4: Deploying a go binary in a closed ecosystem (i.e. internal tool for other engineers) - Martin

If Brew, NPM, [go releaser](https://goreleaser.com/) or other options are not possible because the tool is not open source.

- Use brew with a private cask
- Use go run (needs go installed)
- Use [ORAs](https://oras.land/) to distribute artifacts using an OCI registry
- Use auto update mechanism in the binary (does not solve initial install)
- Use a Device management solution to push the binary to company machines or make them available as self service install i.e. [JAMF](https://www.jamf.com/)
- Provide the tool in a container and provide a [dev container config](https://containers.dev/)
- Use a [nix](https://nixos.org) package
- Use Github [gh cli extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/using-github-cli-extensions) to install the tools
- Use [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and run the tool within
