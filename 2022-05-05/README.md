## Another Web Assembly Talk: Interacting with the web â€“ Patrick Fiaux

Pure functional programing is great especially in web assembly, on rare occasions however when side effects are desirable we need inputs and outputs. We'll look beyond the bootstrap of web assembly compiled go, focusing how we can handle inputs, load assets, and output data back to the browser side. To conclude we'll demo how all these can make retro gaming possible in the browser.
