## CI Pipeline as code with dagger – Christian Schlatter

We're going to explain the limitations of current CI tools and introduce you a new open-source solution called Dagger. Using Dagger, developers can define and maintain their CI pipelines as true Go code, giving them greater control and flexibility over the process. This approach leads to a more efficient and streamlined CI pipeline developing process."
Christian Schlatter works as a CI/CD Engineer at Puzzle ITC and also as a trainer at Acend for cloud-native technologies. He likes his CI pipelines like his pizza delivery: fast and bug-free.

## pigeon - Generate parsers in Go from PEG grammar – Lucas Bremgartner

Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) is a way to describe the structure of any kind of structured text like programming language, configuration formats or log files. Together we will explore the basics of writing PEGs, practical use cases and how we can generate and use parser implementations for the Go programming language.

## Cross-platform development with Go: practical lessons learned the hard way from chezmoi - Tom Payne

Cross-platform development with Go is easy, right? Just set the GOOS and GOARCH environment variables and boom you have a binary for your target operating system and architecture. The reality is that there's much more to building cross-platform software than making sure that the bytes in the .EXE file are in the right order. This talk will reveal everything that went wrong getting the chezmoi dotfile manager to run on seven different operating systems and eleven different architectures. Lessons learned the hard way, so you can get a head start on your next cross-compiled project.
